domain of Political Economy. It was the time as well of the vulgarising and extending of
Ricardo’s theory, as of the contest of that theory with the old school. Splendid tournaments were
held. What was done then, is little known to the Continent generally, because the polemic is for

exceptional cases, as a weapon of attack upon bourgeois economy – is explained by the
circumstances of the time. On the one hand, modern industry itself was only just emerging from
the age of childhood, as is shown by the fact that with the crisis of 1825 it for the first time opens
